# This workflow runs whenever a PR is opened or updated, or a commit is pushed to main. It runs
# several checks:
# - fmt: checks that the code is formatted according to rustfmt
# - clippy: checks that the code does not contain any clippy warnings
# - doc: checks that the code can be documented without errors
# - hack: check combinations of feature flags
# - msrv: check that the msrv specified in the crate is correct
